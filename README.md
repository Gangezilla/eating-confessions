# Eating Confessions
Hi! This is a very basic server for an app idea I had once when I was eating a giant bowl of spaghetti. I wanted somewhere that I could anonymously post about things, or quantities of things I've eaten that I probably shouldn't have. I also had been meaning to dabble in languages other than JavaScript, so I wrote this to learn some C# and .NET Core. It's pretty basic, but any feedback would be valued, as well as any eating confessions you have to contribute as well, you can do it here:
